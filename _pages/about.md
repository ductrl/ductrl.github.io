Hi! I'm Mike Ly. I'm a Vietnamese student who intends to pursue a Computer Science degree at the University of Virginia. I am interested in the field of machine learning but also looking to explore other fields to broaden my programming versatility. I am a firm believer in active learning and keeping an open mind, so I am constantly looking to apply what I learn to any projects I can think of.

Outside of programming, I am a music enthusiast who plays the drums and a bit of guitar. I am also an avid NBA fan whose favorite team is the Milwaukee Bucks. I love discussing my passions, so you can reach out to me to discuss pretty much anything, from trash-talking my basketball ability to exploring your favorite deep learning concept!
